**What are Gaussian Processes - PART 1** </br>
Introduction to Gaussian Processes, Bayes Theorem, Non-parametric Models and Applications. 
I've created a Streamlit App that allows you to explore Gaussian Processes and visualise their behaviour.

**The Kernel Cookbook - PART 2** </br>
Exploration of different kernels, combinations and covariance matrices. 
I've created a Streamlit App that allows you to explore how different kernels with different values for their hyperparameters affect prior and posterior distrubitions of a Gaussian Process as well as their 3d surface representation.

**AutoML in twinLab - PART 3** </br>
Discovering twinLab's AutoML functionalities for automatic kernel selection.
I've created a notebook in where I explore kernels and how these affect the quantification of uncertainty and the evaluation metrics. I illustrate how to use AutoML to automatically select the kernel, aiming to enhance regression outcomes.
